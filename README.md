# README

What I'm trying to do is create a site which explains how various kinds of data are interpreted and parsed.

The main use I had in mind was as a kind of tool to aid developer, somewhat like Richard Ishida's excellent [Unicode Code Converter][1].

Part of the problem is that utility and frameworks don't exist for this already (or maybe I just can't find them. If you know of anything, let me know!) So I find myself reimplementing basic stuff from scratch, making this perhaps a more ambitious project than I would like. :(

This application requires:

* Ruby 2.1
* Bundler (which you will use to get all other dependencies)
